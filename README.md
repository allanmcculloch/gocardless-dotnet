### :warning: __This client library is no longer supported__

This library isn't supported or maintained to the same high standard as our other projects, so we would advise that you don't use it to build a new integration.

If you're working with our API using .NET, you should make HTTP requests to our API directly ([documentation](https://developer.gocardless.com)) instead.

The source will remain available, so you can modify it to suit your requirements if you still wish to use this library.
